This file shows you how to run the analysis, describing the needed files and what they do:

* Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Unzip it and make sure the folder is named "UCI HAR Dataset" if it's not, rename it. This will be our dataset
* Run with `source("run_analysis.R")
* A new file will be created with the tidy data, you can read it with the read.table command
